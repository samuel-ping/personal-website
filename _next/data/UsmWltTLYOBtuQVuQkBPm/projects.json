When I wrote this program, I made an effort to follow Python best practices, which included:\n\n- Using a config file over global variables.\n- Creating a Python virtual environment and using a `requirements.txt` file to keep track of Pip packages.\n- Organizing my code by splitting my it into multiple files.\n- Documenting each function I wrote, as well as how to install and use the tool.\n\nIn addition to those, I also learned about many other topics. This includes:\n\n- Object-oriented programming in Python.\n- Python data structures.\n- Stopwords and other methods of cleaning data. While there's no AI going on in my tool, it was interesting to learn that stopwords are commonly used to clean data in natural language processing."},{"details":{"title":"Food Mood","short-description":"Web app that takes your photo, detects your visible mood, and suggests a restaurant based off that mood!","thumbnail":"assets/food-mood-thumbnail-raw.jpg","start-date":"March 2020","end-date":"August 2020","repo-url":"https://github.com/samuel-ping/food-mood","website-url":"https://foodmood.samuelping.me/","technologies":"React.js, Express.js, Node.js, AWS (Lambda, Amplify, EC2, CodeDeploy+CodePipeline, S3), Nginx"},"description":"\n<ins>**Summary**</ins>\n\nFood Mood is a web app that takes your photo, detects your visible mood, and suggests a restaurant based off of that mood!\n\nThe frontend is written in React.js, while the backend uses Express.js and Node.js. The backend is a Lambda function hosted on AWS Lambda, which makes a call to Yelp's Fusion API and Amazon's Rekognition API.\n\n**v3**: My current and most likely final iteration of Food Mood is v3. I completely revamped the way the website looks, making it more visually appealing. I also switched over from hosting on AWS EC2 to AWS Amplify to see what Amplify is like.\n\n<ins>**Previous Versions**</ins>\n\n**v2**: The frontend is built with React.js, while the backend uses Express.js and Node.js. The emotions are detected from the photo using Amazon's Rekognition API, and then I search for a restaurant using Yelp's Fusion API. The website is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, using Nginx as a reverse proxy. Updates to the application are automatically deployed with AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy.\n\n**v1**: The [original Food Mood](https://oldmyfoodmood.herokuapp.com/) was my first ever website, and I built it as an entry to Capital One's Software Engineering Summit challenge. I originally was going to use solely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I quickly learned that I had no way of hiding my API keys from the client. After much frustration, I found Node.js and Express.js and decided to hail mary it and learn how to create a backend. I'm really proud of this project, because I decided to pursue this project at the last minute and had less than two days to complete it. After the competition ended (I was accepted into the summit!), I decided to continue working on this project. I revamped the whole website with React and deployed it on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance to avoid the yucky slow loading times of Heroku.\n"},{"details":{"title":"Personal Website","short-description":"My personal website!","thumbnail":"assets/personal-website.png","start-date":"May 2020","end-date":"","repo-url":"https://github.com/samuel-ping/personal-website","website-url":"https://samuelping.me","technologies":"Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Netlify CMS, Matomo Analytics"},"description":"\n<ins>**Summary**</ins>\n\nMy personal website is built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS.
