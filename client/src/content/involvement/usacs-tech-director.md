USACS (short for Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists) is the largest computer science-related club at Rutgers.

<ins>**April 2021 - Present: Tech Director**</ins>

I'm currently the tech director for USACS for the next academic year. My job is to promote hacker culture and inspire project building in the Rutgers computer science community.

<ins>**October 2020 - May 2021: Mentor**</ins>

I mentored two computer science undergraduate at Rutgers. I gave them advice about academics, college, and internship hunting. I also made them a [simple website](https://samuel-ping.github.io/intro-to-git/) to teach them the basics of Git!... unfortunately I don't think they ever used it :(

<ins>**September 2019 - April 2021: Member**</ins>

I attended and contributed to weekly town halls. I also mentored at a local high school hackathon.
