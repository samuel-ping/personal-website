# Personal Website

My personal website! Built with Next.js and TailwindCSS. The backend uses Netlify CMS to provide easy edits to my site. The server's purpose is to authenticate me through GitHub using OAuth to access the CMS.

## Getting Started

Go into client and run npm i then npm run dev to run site in development mode.
