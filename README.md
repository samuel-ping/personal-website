# Personal Website

This is my third refresh of my personal website. I built it using Next.js, with Netlify CMS to provide easy edits to my site. The server's purpose is to authenticate me through GitHub using OAuth to make the edits.

### Notes

- config.yml
  - can add logo_url
  - use {{year}} {{month}} {{date}} slugs for resume?
