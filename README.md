# Personal Website

My personal website! Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The backend uses Netlify CMS to provide easy edits to my site. The server's purpose is to authenticate me through GitHub using OAuth to access the CMS. I also set up Matomo Analytics just for fun, to see where in the world people are looking at my website from!
