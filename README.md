# Personal Website

My personal website! Built with Next.js and ChakraUI. The backend uses Netlify CMS to provide easy edits to my site. The server's purpose is to authenticate me through GitHub using OAuth to access the CMS.

## Notes

#### Converting SVG to JSX (using svgr)

```
npx @svgr/cli < ../temp/<svg file>.svg > ../temp/<output file name>.js
```
